# node-starter-project

## Pre-requisites

Requires node.js `v8.9.3` and npm `5.5.1`.

## Instalation and development

After cloning the project and ensuring you're running Node.js 8 and npm 5, you can run the following npm scripts:

### Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Run tests

```
npm run test
```

During development, you can also run the following script that skips linting and istanbul coverage reporting for fastest results:

```
npm run test:app
```

### Start the application

```
npm run start
```

You can also start it in live reload mode (ideal during development), running the following script:

```
npm run start:watch
```
